# Some projects that I have done over time 

My name is Racoviță Răzvan-Ionuț and I am a Computer Science student at Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj Napoca's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer-Science.

This repository houses all of the projects I've completed, but I still have others in progress (in Java, C, C# and SQL)
